# Strings
A **string** is a sequence of ``Unicode`` scalar values encoded as a stream of ``UTF-8`` bytes.<br>

Rust has two main types of strings: ``&str`` and ``String``.

# ``&str``
The ``&str`` type is called **string literal** or **string slice**.<br>
*Strings* of ``&str`` type are **statically allocated**, i.e., they are hardcoded into binary and exists while programme is running.<br>
*Strings* of ``&str`` type have a **fixed-size** and **cannot be mutated**, i.e., they are **immutable**.<br>

### Examples
```Rust
let s: &str = "ABC";
```

<br>

# ``String``
The ``String`` is a sequence that is allowed to **grow** or **shrink** *in size* **at runtime** and is provided by Rust's standard library.

### Examples
- Instantiating ``String`` variables by ``String`` **constructor** (``new()``):
```Rust
let s: String = String::new();
```

- Instantiating ``String`` variables from ``&str`` values:
```Rust
let s1: String = String::from("ABC");
```
```Rust
let s2: String = "ABC".to_string();
```
