# ``Box<T>``
```Rust
fn main() {
    let v = Box::new(1);
    println!("v = {}", v);
}
```

Notes:
- The value (``1``) is allocated on the **heap**.
- The data in the **box** is accessed the same way as the data were on the stack. 
- When a **box** goes out of scope, the value of ``Box`` type (``v``) and the value it points to (``1``) are both dealocated.

# Implementation of Box
Under the hood ``Box`` can be represented as:
```Rust
use std::ops::Deref;

struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> MyBox<T> {
    fn new(x: T) -> MyBox<T> {
        MyBox(x)
    }
}

// To support dereference: 
//   let v = MyBox::new(1); 
//   let r = *v;
impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
        &self.0
    }
}
```
