# Lifetime
A **lifetime** is the **scope** within which a **reference** is **valid**.<br>

The notation ``'a`` is **lifetime** ``a``.<br>

Technically, **every reference** **has** some **lifetime** associated with it, but the compiler lets you **elide** them in common cases.<br>
It is called **lifetime elision** or **implicit lifetime annotation**. It is because the Rust compiler is smart enough to infer lifetimes in many cases.<br>
But sometimes it is needed to specify lifetimes **explicitly**. That’s because of how the lifetime elision works.<br>
When a function accepts **multiple references**, they’re **each** given **their own lifetime**.<br>

From Rust point of view, signature:``fn f (s1: &str, s2: &str) → &str `` is **equal** to signature:``fn f<'a, 'b> (s1: &'a str, s2: &'b str) → &'??? str``<br>

So, rustc sets to ``s1`` and ``s2`` **different** lifetimes and rustc **doesn't** know what lifetime to assign to **returning value**.<br>
That is why compiler return error. So we must **explicitly** set lifetimes for input and output parameters.<br>
Example: ``fn f<'a> (s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) → &'a str``.<br>

The **lifetimes** help Rust find **dangling pointers**. Example:<br>
```Rust
#![allow(dead_code)]
#![allow(unused_variables)]
#![allow(unused_mut)]

fn max<'a>(x: &'a i32, y: &'a i32) -> &'a i32 {
    if *x > *y {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = 1;
    let z = {
        let y = 2;
        max(&x, &y)
    }; // returning value must outlive y because y deallocated here
    println!("z: {}", *z)
}
```

```bash
cargo run
   Compiling playrs v0.1.0 (/Users/an.romanov/Projects/play.rust-lang.org)

## Lifetimes in functions
For function there are 2 kind of lifetimes:
- **Input lifetime** is a lifetime associated with a **parameter** of a function. 
- **Output lifetime** is a lifetime associated with the **return value** of a function.

Lifetimes rules:
- Each elided lifetime in a function’s signature becomes a **distinct** lifetime of function’s parameter.
- If there is exactly one **input lifetime**, it is assigned to all *elided* **lifetimes** in the **return values** of that function.
- If there are **multiple** **input lifetimes**, but one of them is ``&self`` or ``&mut self``, the **lifetime** of ``self`` is assigned to all *elided* **output lifetimes**.

## Lifetimes in Structs
```Rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: &'a i64,
}

fn main() {
    let nref = &1;
    let f = Foo { x: nref };
    println!("{}", f.x);
}
```

<br>

## Lifetimes in impl blocks
```Rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    x: &'a i32,
}

impl<'a> Foo<'a> {
    fn x(&self) -> &'a i32 { self.x }
}

fn main() {
    let nref = &1;
    let f = Foo { x: nref };
    println!("x is: {}", f.x());
}
```

<br>

## 'static
The lifetime named ``'static`` is a special lifetime. It signals that something has the **lifetime of the entire program**.<br>
**String literal** has the type ``&str``, but under the hood, ``&str`` is ``&'static str`` because the **reference** is **always alive**: it's **hardcoded into the data segment of the final binary**.

``'static`` *lifetime* **allows return reference to value from function**:
```Rust
fn create_string() -> &'static str {
    let s = String::from("abc");
    &s
}
```

<br>

## Lifetime subtyping
Consider following code:
```Rust
fn max<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) -> &'a i32 {
    if *x > *y {
        x
    } else {
        y
    }
}
```

```bash
cargo run
   Compiling playrs v0.1.0 (/Users/an.romanov/Projects/play.rust-lang.org)
error[E0623]: lifetime mismatch

   |                               this parameter and the return type are declared with different lifetimes...

```

This program **doesn't compile**, because the lifetimes ``'a`` and ``'b`` are **independent**.<br>

Rust allows you to declare that lifetime ``a`` contains another lifetime. It is called **lifetime subtyping**.<br>
Notations of **lifetime subtyping**:<br>
- ``fn max<'a, 'b: 'a>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) -> &'a i32``;
- ``fn max<'a, 'b>(x: &'a i32, y: &'b i32) -> &'a i32 where 'b: 'a``;

Notation ``'b: 'a`` means ``'b`` **outlives** ``'a``, and ``'b`` is a **subtype** of ``'a``, i.e., ``'a`` <= ``'b``.
