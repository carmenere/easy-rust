# Combinators on ``Option``/``Result``
The only way to safely interact with ``Option`` and ``Result`` **inner values** is either through **pattern matching** or **if let**.<br>
This paradigm of using **matching** is a very common operation and, as such, it becomes very tedious having to write them every time.<br>
Fortunately, ``Option`` and ``Result`` come with lots of **helper methods** implemented on them, also known as **combinators**, that allow you to manipulate the **inner values** easily.

## ``match`` example

```Rust
match some_value {
    Some(v) => 1,
    None => 10
}
```

<br>

## ``if let`` example
```Rust
if let Some(v) = some_value {
    println!("Matched {:?}!", v);
}
```

The `if let` construct reads: if ``let`` destructures ``some_value`` into ``Some(v)``, evaluate the block (``{ }``).
