# Anonymous lifetimes
Notation `<'_>` is **anonymous lifetime** and it is an indicator that references are being used. 

Consider following example:
```Rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    f: &'a str
}

impl<'a> Foo<'a> {
    fn foo(&self) {
        println!("{}", self.f)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let foo = Foo{f: "abc"};
    foo.foo();
}
```

The same code, but with **anonymous lifetime**:
```Rust
struct Foo<'a> {
    f: &'a str
}

impl Foo<'_> {
    fn foo(&self) {
        println!("{}", self.f)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let foo = Foo{f: "abc"};
    foo.foo();
}
```
